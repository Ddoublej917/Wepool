# Wepool
## _Description_
- Wepool at its core is a professional ride sharing service. When a User signs up, they can input their car ride preferences in a questionnaire as well as their destination, and the app will output recommended carpooling groups for them to join. If they don’t like any of the group options, they can start their own, and others can join their group. After users are matched together, a route is created for the driver via Google maps, including stops at all group member’s pickup locations arranged optimally before arriving at their shared work destination. Should a user have any problems with their car ride, they have the options to submit issue reports to moderators tied to the company subscribed to our service. These moderators can resolve disputes and reassign carpooling groups as needed. At any time, a user can update their preferences and join or create a group even after being assigned to one. Other various features include an easy to navigate frontend built with Angular Material, an accordion dropdown for users to see contact information for other members of their group, map visualization of the route, and directions of the route outputted to the driver.
